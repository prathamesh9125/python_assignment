Assignment on basic data structures: 
1.  Write a Python program to accept n numbers in list and remove 
duplicates from a list.  09-11-24     
2.  Write a Python program to merge two lists and remove any 
duplicates. 09-11-24     
3.  Write a Python program to reverse a list without using built-in 
functions like reverse() or without slicing. . 09-11-24     
4.  
Write a Python program to rotate a list to the right by a given 
number of positions. For example, rotating [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] by 2 
positions would result in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].  
09-11-24     
5.  Write a Python program that combines two sorted lists into a single 
sorted list without using built-in sorting methods.  09-11-24     
6.  Write a Python program to swap the values of two variables using a 
tuple.  09-11-24     
7.  Write a program to concatenate two tuples and find the length of the 
resulting tuple.  09-11-24     
8.  Write a Python program to find the intersection of two sets without 
using the built-in intersection() function.  09-11-24     
9.  
Using a set, write a Python program that removes duplicate 
elements from a list and prints the unique elements in the order they 
appeared in the list. 
09-11-24     
10.  Create a Python program that takes a set of numbers and returns a 
new set containing only the even numbers.  09-11-24     
11.  Write a Python program to merge two dictionaries and resolve any 
key conflicts by summing the values for common keys.  09-11-24     
12.  
Write a Python program that takes a dictionary of student names as 
keys and their scores as values. Return the name of the student with 
the highest score. 
09-11-24     
13.  
Using a dictionary, write a Python program that groups the list of 
tuples by the first element of the tuple. For example, given [('a', 1), 
('b', 2), ('a', 3)], group it as {'a': [1, 3], 'b': [2]}. 
09-11-24     
14.  Write a Python program to check if a given key already exists in a 
dictionary. If key exists replace with another key/value pair. 09-11-24     
15.  
Write a Python script to generate and print a dictionary which 
contains a number (between 1 and n) in the form(x, x*x). Sample 
Dictionary (n=5) Expected Output: {1:1, 2:4, 3:9, 4:16, 5:25} 
09-11-24     
16.  
Write a Python program to convert a tuple of string values to a tuple 
of integer values. Original tuple values: (('333', '33'), ('1416', '55')) 
New tuple values: ((333, 33), (1416, 55)) 
09-11-24     
17.  
Write a Python program to compute element-wise sum of given 
tuples. Original lists: (1, 2, 3, 4) (3, 5, 2, 1) (2, 2, 3, 1) Element-wise 
sum of the said tuples: (6, 9, 8, 6) 
09-11-24     
18.  
Write a python program to count repeated characters in a string.  
Sample string: 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy 
dog'  
Expected output: o-4, e-3, u-2, h-2, r-2, t-2, ‘ ’-7.

which have odd index values of given string using user defined 
function. 
09-11-24     
22.  Given a list of integers, create a Python function that returns the 
second largest number. 09-11-24     
23.
